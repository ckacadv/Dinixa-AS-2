<h3>Dinixa Desktop is finally here! New deisgn! New stuff! New services!</h3>
So as you saw Dinixa Desktop is finally released! 
On the first you probbably saw that windows called
"Dinixa Desktop Launcher" or "DDL" so what it does is 
really simple stuff. It goes to Dinixa Skojur and
checks if it's accesible. If it is then it will pull
this stuff from Skojir like photos, text, etc...
What is diffrence between www.renatogr.cf Desktop and
Dinixa Desktop? Well there is a lot of diffrent stuff
like there is no more posts and no more fake app store
if Dinixa Apps ever come to DD (It will happen...) it
will be an actual store, not just a page with buttons that show 
info aboput the ap and redirect you tro the browser
here it will be a downloading throught DD. Update option
will come i don't really know when but it will be here
and i have to do something with my provider about internet
and that stuff. So that's all i wanted to tell you
browse this new app! Bye!!!
