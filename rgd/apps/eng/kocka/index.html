Dice, dice is a simple program for "throwing" a dice that will start spinning the dice by pressing the start button until you press anywhere within the program but not on the start button

As far as I know he works on:

Linux: x86 x64 (I haven't tested)

MacOS: (it should work but I didn't test it because I'm not soft)

Windows: 7,8,8.1,10 (I guess 11) x86 x64

Android: no

iOS: no

Windows phone: no

NOTE: if you are using windows 8 onwards (8.1 or 10) windows defender will tell you that it is a virus but don't worry just presss more or whatever it says in this text and then click run anyway and that's it.
