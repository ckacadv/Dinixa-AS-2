In 52 minutes 2021 is done! Wish you happy new year and lot of happiness! I wish to learn css better and to make this site prettier, get money to buy myself VPS so you won't need to go every few minutes here and take new URL for in app services. But, wishes are just wishes, some will come true some will not. But it's not time to talk what i want it's time when we all have to be happy and together with people we love! And also i added this snow that falls only on this page. Like it? Shhhh, i copy pasted it from spacehey's advent calendar

Again happy new 2022!

Wow, time flies...
