You see the title so let me start right away. This page will have an app but don't worry everything will be there will

be posts and you will have to have an account on this page but you will be able to create an account in the app as

well. The application will have one option that this page will never have and that is codes, so everything will work

and it will be typed in the registration of a new account THROUGH THE APPLICATION and if you already have an account

you will be able to go to settings add code and type new code. There will also be a code that I hid somewhere

on the page, which will not always be in the same place, and when you type it, the application with all the current

codes and keys will be downloaded, which will work, so when you enter it says to connect to the database on internet

where all the codes and keys are, when connected you press to browse the database and below everything will be

downloaded and displayed. Oh yes and the name I forgot to say will be called, www.renatogr.cf Desktop. If you have a

better suggestion, write in the comments or send it to me in DM (of course here on the site). I'm preparing another

application for now, but I won't say anything about it until I put it on. And that both of the apps I mentioned

earlier can't work without the internet. Byeeeeeee
