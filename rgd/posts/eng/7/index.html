So who didn't noticed, this site has wordpress, so since it was made, so I have been planning to start

this for a long time now. So I'm starting to write html and css for this page, I'll make a segment here now

where I'll put pictures of what it will look like until I'm done. I have no idea when I will finish it

but you will have screen shots so you will see what it looks like. So just to say right away there is no

chance that I know or manage to write a page like this wordpress theme with all these animations means it

will be worse but it will be my work and not someone else's. That's all I wanted to tell you. Byeeeee !!!!!
