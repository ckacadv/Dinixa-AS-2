So, i did it. Finally i have online features in my apps that ACTUALLY WORK! Currently only 2 of my apps support this and 
they are 1.www.renatogr.cf Desktop and 2.ITM/BMI calculator. 2. is currently in alfa beta beta in dev version and 
www.renatogr.cf Desktop currently has working store and it has thing that looks how much posts are here. I had to restart 
www.renatogr.cf Desktop project which means it no longer has ton of broken stuff in it and it no longer uses 
www.renatogr.cf Server because they worked in really dumb way but they worked (regr Server and regr Desktop). 
Desktop app and server were literally sending messages to each other like desktop ap will send message to server that 
goes "gimme tile 3" and server will respond "+(text from post 3)" and client app will look if first char of message 
has + and if it does than it will put it into field that is made for that. I know really dumb but hey it worked, sort off. 
But why i scraped regr Server and redone regr Desktop? Because only one client is able to connect to one server and i 
phisicly can not port forwoard that with my pc and then i just told myself "You are just wasting your time by doing this 
shit which won't work! Yust do it with http server" And now regr Desktop uses http server 
(Thats the url on top of the page) it's still in beta (AGAIN) and i will finally be able to publish 
www.renatogr.cf Desktop 4.0 because older versions 3.x were not able to "log in" withouth server and i told why that's 
not really possible. So if you want to try out new version of regr Desktop go to apps.regr.cf and find it! 
Note: If it start to give you errors just go to this page and on top you will se an url just copy it and open 
regr Desktop open settings and click first thing and there paste url (there is field that is caller URL)
