The options for login, registration and the "wall" on which you can write anything else are returned.

If you didn't know, all those things were removed, so now they're coming back.

Groups and private chats should return. ALL ACCOUNTS THAT WERE REGISTERED BEFORE REMOVING THE LOGIN OPTION WERE

NOT DELETED !!!
