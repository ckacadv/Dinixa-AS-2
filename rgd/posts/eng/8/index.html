So, preview of the new website design was on website https://demo.renatogr.cf/regrmain.html

In the post under this i said why will i change the website again but i'll say it again. I don't really want

Wordpress because when it decide to update something whole website become unusable. And i wanted to have

website which is completly made by me, so now i write posts in .html files instead of using some post makers

like i did with wordpress.

Yes i know that this is just downgrade but for me website is completly in my hands and i can do anything

at any time without waiting for some plugins to update.

And i also have to tell you i will make the login againg here and it will no longer be working

with Ultimatemember or buddy press. I don't know will old accounts still be avilable but i don't see why they

won't be usable. And also another information, i will rename www.renatogr.cf Apps into www.renatogr.cf Shop

and i will change it's website! That's it i will not leak you anymore informations.

Byeeeee
